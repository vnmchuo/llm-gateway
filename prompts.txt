You are a senior Go engineer validating the `llm-gateway` server startup.

main.go is already fully implemented. Now run the server and verify it starts correctly.

## Step 1: Verify .env file is complete

Make sure .env contains all required values. It should look like this:

```env
# Server
PORT=8081

# Database
POSTGRES_DSN=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/llm_gateway?sslmode=disable

# Cache
REDIS_ADDR=localhost:6379

# Providers — fill in your real API keys
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# Observability
OTEL_EXPORTER_TYPE=stdout
OTEL_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317

# Rate Limiting
DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT_TPM=100000
```

Important notes:
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY can be empty — Claude will use mock mode
- GEMINI_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY must be real keys for end-to-end testing
- Do NOT commit .env to git — verify .env is in .gitignore

## Step 2: Run migrations

```bash
make migrate
```

Expected output:
```
Running migrations...
Applying migrations/001_create_api_keys.sql...
Applying migrations/002_create_usage_logs.sql...
```

If migrations already applied, postgres will skip with "already exists" — this is fine.

## Step 3: Start server with seed

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
RUN_SEED=true go run cmd/gateway/main.go
```

Expected log output (order may vary slightly):
```
PostgreSQL connected
Redis connected
[Seeder] Test API key created successfully
[Seeder] Key: test-api-key-12345
[Seeder] TenantID: tenant-test-001
LLM Gateway starting on port 8081
```

If seeder says "API key may already exist, skipping" — that is fine, key was already seeded before.

Server must start without any panic or fatal error.

## Step 4: Health check (run in a NEW terminal, keep server running)

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8081/healthz | jq .
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "llm-gateway"
}
```

## Step 5: Verify 401 on protected route without auth

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gemini-1.5-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

Expected output: `401`

## Step 6: Verify 501 on placeholder job route

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test-api-key-12345" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq .
```

Expected:
```json
{"error": "async jobs coming in phase 2"}
```
